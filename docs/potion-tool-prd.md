# PRD: Skyrim Reference Site — Potion Tool (v1)

## 1. Overview

A personal-use web reference site for Skyrim (Special Edition + all DLC). The goal is fast, friction-free access to tools that the existing wikis make unnecessarily hard to use. The site starts with a potion/alchemy tool and is designed to grow into additional tools over time.

---

## 2. Site Structure

### Homepage
- Minimal content — acts as a navigation hub to tools only
- Cards or large buttons for each tool (Potion Mixer, future tools)
- No hero text, no lore fluff, no search landing

### Tools (v1)
- **Potion Mixer** — the focus of this PRD

### Planned future tools (not in scope for v1)
- Enchanting Calculator
- Trainer Finder
- Standing Stones Reference
- Shout / Word Wall Tracker
- Missable Content Checklist
- Skill Book Finder
- Character Generator

## 3. Potion Mixer Tool

### 3.1 Core Concept

Skyrim alchemy works as follows:
- Every ingredient has exactly **4 effects**
- You combine **2 or 3 ingredients** at an alchemy table
- A potion gains an effect only if **at least 2 of the chosen ingredients share that effect**
- More ingredient overlap = more effects on the resulting potion

### 3.2 Interaction Model — Linked Two-Column Layout

The tool has no mode toggle. Instead, two linked columns sit side by side: **Ingredients** and **Effects**. You start from whichever side you care about, and the columns filter each other bidirectionally.

#### Card states

Every ingredient and effect is a small clickable card. Cards exist in one of three states, which also determine their position in their column:

| State | Meaning | Position |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Selected** | Actively chosen by the user | Pinned to the top of the column, visually highlighted (active border/background) |
| **Default** | Compatible with the current selection | Middle of the column, full opacity |
| **Muted** | Incompatible with the current selection | Bottom of the column, reduced opacity (~40%), still readable |

#### Initial state

On page load, all ingredients and all effects are listed alphabetically in their columns, all in the **default** state. Nothing is muted.

#### Starting from an ingredient

1. Click an ingredient → it becomes **selected** and pins to the top of the Ingredients column. All other ingredients become **muted**.
2. In the Effects column: the 4 effects of that ingredient stay **default**; all other effects become **muted** and drop down.
3. Click a desired effect → ingredients sharing that effect with the selection are promoted from muted back to **default**, showing which ingredients combine with the original to make that potion.

#### Starting from an effect

1. Click an effect → it becomes **selected** and pins to the top of the Effects column. All other effects become **muted**.
2. In the Ingredients column: ingredients that have that effect are promoted to **default** at the top; incompatible ingredients become **muted** and drop to the bottom.
3. Click ingredients to add them to the potion (up to 3). Each selected ingredient pins to the top of its column.
4. When one or more ingredients are selected, their *other* effects are promoted from muted into the **default** band beneath the selected effect, so they can be selected too and added to the potion.

#### In short

- **Ingredient selected** → its effects shown, others muted
- **Effect selected** → its ingredients shown, others muted

#### Constraints & rules

- **Max 3 ingredients.** Once 3 are selected, remaining default ingredients show a clear disabled state (distinct from muted) and cannot be selected until one is removed.
- **Deselection.** Clicking any selected card deselects it and reverses its filtering effect. Selected cards are visually obvious as toggleable.
- **Clear all.** A reset control returns the page to the initial all-default state.

#### Multiple effects selected — grouped ingredient list

When 2 effects are selected, the Ingredients column groups its **default** cards by which effect(s) they contribute to, so it's clear which ingredient serves which effect:

```
── Matches both ──
  [Wheat]  [Garlic]
── Restore Health only ──
  [Blue Mountain Flower]  [Charred Skeever Hide]
── Fortify Stamina only ──
  [Large Antlers]  [Lavender]
```

The **Matches both** group is pinned at the top — these are the best ingredients for a dual-effect potion and directly answer "what should I use." Each ingredient appears in exactly one group (no duplicate cards). Muted (non-matching) ingredients remain at the bottom as usual.

Grouping applies to the 2-effect case. With 3 effects selected the combinatorics get noisy, so the column falls back to a flat "matches at least one" default list rather than many small groups.

The reverse case — multiple *ingredients* selected showing their combined effects — needs no grouping; it simply promotes the union of the selected ingredients' effects into the default band.

---

### 3.3 Data Model

#### Ingredient
```
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  effects: [effectId, effectId, effectId, effectId],  // ordered, first = most potent
  source: "base" | "dawnguard" | "dragonborn" | "hearthfire" | "anniversary",
  isPlantable: boolean,       // can be grown in Hearthfire farm plots
  locationHints: string[]     // broad hints only — hold/region/vendor type, not spawn coords
}
```

**Note on Anniversary Edition content:** AE bundles ~26 Creation Club packs. The most alchemy-relevant is *Rare Curios*, which adds ~40 ingredients from Morrowind and Oblivion (Bonemeal, Saltrice, Marshmerrow, etc.). All AE ingredients share `source: "anniversary"` and are hidden unless the user enables AE in settings.

#### Effect
```
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  type: "beneficial" | "harmful",
  category: "restore" | "fortify" | "resist" | "damage" | "other"
}
```

#### Potion Result (computed, not stored)
```
{
  ingredients: Ingredient[],   // 2 or 3
  effects: Effect[],           // only shared effects
  estimatedValue: number | null
}
```

**Data source:** Manually curated JSON files in `/src/data/`. Skyrim ingredient data is stable and complete — no backend required. Approximate counts:
- Base game: ~100 ingredients
- Dawnguard: ~10
- Dragonborn: ~20
- Hearthfire: minor (mostly affects `isPlantable` flags on existing ingredients)
- Anniversary Edition (Rare Curios + others): ~40

**Location data source:** Location hints are fetched from [UESP](https://en.uesp.net) (the most accurate Skyrim wiki) using its MediaWiki API, processed by a one-off Node.js script in `/scripts/fetch-locations.ts`, and committed into `ingredients.json`. This is a build-time data gathering step, not a runtime fetch. UESP content is licensed CC-BY-SA; we store only factual location descriptions, not wiki prose.

**Location hint policy:** Store broad descriptors only — hold names, environment types (tundra, cave, swamp), vendor types (apothecary, general goods). Do not store specific spawn coordinates. If the UESP data for an ingredient is ambiguous or sparse, leave `locationHints: []` — a blank field is better than a wrong one.

---

### 3.4 Filters & Settings

Filters live in two places:

**Settings modal** (gear icon, persisted to localStorage — set once, forget)
- Content flags: all DLC enabled by default (base game + Dawnguard + Dragonborn + Hearthfire + Anniversary Edition). User unchecks DLC they don't own. Base game cannot be disabled.
- Alchemy skill level (numeric input, 1–100)
- Perk selections (see §3.5)
- Theme selector (see §4.3)

**Inline filter bar** (on the Potion Mixer page, always visible)
- Plantable only toggle — show only ingredients growable in Hearthfire farm plots
- Effect type — beneficial / harmful / both
- Hide mixed-effect results — hide potions that contain both beneficial and harmful effects (overridden by Purity perk)

The split keeps persistent preferences out of the main workflow without burying commonly-used filters in a modal.

---

### 3.5 Alchemy Perks

Optional perk panel the user can configure once and persist via localStorage. Applied perks modify how results are displayed (primarily value estimation and effect filtering).

**Perks to support:**

| Perk | Ranks | Effect on tool |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Alchemist | 5 | Multiplies estimated potion value (20/40/60/80/100% bonus) |
| Physician | 1 | +25% strength to potions that restore Health, Magicka, or Stamina |
| Benefactor | 1 | +25% strength to potions with only beneficial effects |
| Poisoner | 1 | +25% strength to poisons with only harmful effects |
| Purity | 1 | Removes all negative effects from potions; removes all positive effects from poisons. When enabled: negative effects are stripped from potion results and do not count toward value |
| Green Thumb | 1 | Display note only: "You gather 2x ingredients from plants" |
| Concentrated Poison | 1 | Display note only: "Your poisons last twice as long on weapons" |

Perks are saved to localStorage so they persist between sessions without needing an account.

---

### 3.6 Potion Value Estimation

When alchemy skill level (1–100) and relevant perks are set, display an estimated gold value for each result. This uses the standard Skyrim formula:

```
Base value = sum of (effect base value × magnitude multiplier)
Final value = base value × (1 + 0.015 × skill) × perk multipliers
```

This is a guide value, not exact — display as "~450 gold" to set expectations. Skill level defaults to blank (no estimate shown) until the user sets it.

---

### 3.7 Suggested Additional Features

These are worth discussing before building:

1. **Shareable URLs** — The potion tool's current selection is encoded as a clean route, not query params, so it can be bookmarked, shared, and indexed. E.g. `/potions/brew/blue-mountain-flower+wheat+lavender`. Static ingredient and effect pages (`/ingredients/[slug]`, `/effects/[slug]`) are pre-rendered at build time and fully indexable.

2. **"What's missing" mode** — Given a desired potion effect, show which single ingredient you'd need to add to your current selection to unlock that effect.

3. **Ingredient detail panel** — Click any ingredient to see all 4 effects, its source DLC, whether it's plantable, and a brief location hint (e.g. "common in The Rift, sold by apothecaries").

4. **Conflict highlighter** — When a potion would have both beneficial and harmful effects, visually flag it. Relevant for deciding whether to use Purity.

5. **Result export / shopping list** — A simple "copy to clipboard" of the recipe list, useful for noting what to farm.

6. **Alchemy skill input for leveling math** — Show how much XP a given potion grants toward the next skill level. Nice-to-have, not MVP.

---

## 4. Technical Architecture

### 4.1 Stack

| Layer | Decision |
|-------|----------|
| Framework | **Next.js** (App Router, `output: 'export'`) |
| Language | TypeScript |
| Styling | **Tailwind CSS v4** |
| Components | **shadcn/ui** (Radix UI primitives + Tailwind) |
| Testing | **Vitest** (logic only) |
| Hosting | **GitHub Pages** (free, via GitHub Actions) |

No backend. All data is static JSON. No API routes, no server-side rendering at runtime — Next.js runs at build time only.

---

### 4.2 Why Next.js over plain Vite

The key requirement is **Google-indexable pages** for each ingredient and effect. Next.js App Router with static export achieves this: ingredient and effect pages are pre-rendered to HTML at build time via `generateStaticParams()`, so crawlers see real content without executing JavaScript.

The potion tool itself (`/potions`) is a Client Component (`'use client'`) — fully interactive React, just not pre-rendered beyond the shell.

```ts
// next.config.ts
const nextConfig = {
  output: 'export',   // produces /out as pure static HTML/CSS/JS
  trailingSlash: true,
}
```

---

### 4.3 Styling: Tailwind + shadcn/ui

**Tailwind CSS v4** for all layout and utility styling.

**shadcn/ui** for interactive components (Modal/Dialog, Select, Checkbox, Switch, Tooltip, Sheet/Drawer). shadcn/ui components are copied into the repo as source files — no library lock-in, fully customisable with Tailwind classes.

**Theming** uses CSS custom properties defined in `globals.css`, toggled via a `data-theme` attribute on `<html>`. Three themes:

| Theme | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Nordic Dark | Dark slate grays, warm amber/gold accents — matches vanilla Skyrim UI palette |
| Parchment | Warm cream/sepia tones, aged-paper aesthetic — high contrast light mode |
| System | Follows OS light/dark preference, maps to Nordic/Parchment respectively |

Active theme stored in localStorage. Selector in the settings modal.

---

### 4.4 Routing & Static Generation

```
/                               → Homepage (navigation hub)
/potions                        → Potion Mixer tool (interactive, client component)
/ingredients                    → Ingredient list (static)
/ingredients/[slug]             → Individual ingredient page (statically generated)
/effects                        → Effect list (static)
/effects/[slug]                 → Individual effect page (statically generated)
```

Ingredient and effect detail pages are generated from the JSON data files at build time. The potion tool URL can encode selections as a clean path segment for shareability, though dynamic combination paths are not pre-rendered (too many permutations).

---

### 4.5 Hosting: GitHub Pages

Next.js static export outputs to `/out`. A GitHub Actions workflow on push to `main` builds and deploys this folder to GitHub Pages.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml (outline)
- run: npm run build          # next build → /out
- uses: actions/deploy-pages  # deploys /out to GitHub Pages
```

**URL:** `https://georgecampbel.github.io/skyrim`
Custom domain can be added at any time — GitHub Pages supports it with free HTTPS via Let's Encrypt.

**Free tier limits** (not a concern for this project):
- 1GB repo size soft limit
- 100GB/month bandwidth

---

### 4.6 Mobile-First Layout

The site is most likely used on a phone as a second screen while playing. The interaction model (§3.2) is two linked columns. Layout decisions:

- On tablet/desktop: the Ingredients and Effects columns sit side by side; the filter bar is inline above them.
- On mobile: two columns don't fit comfortably side by side. The two columns become tabbed (Ingredients / Effects segmented control), with a persistent summary of the current selection visible above the tabs so context isn't lost when switching. The filter bar collapses to a "Filters" button opening a bottom sheet (shadcn/ui Sheet).

---

### 4.7 If a Backend Is Ever Needed

If user accounts, saved builds, or community recipes are added later:
- **Backend:** FastAPI on Render free tier
- **Database:** Supabase free tier (Postgres + auth)
- **Caveat:** Render free tier spins down after 15 min of inactivity (~30s cold start). Acceptable for personal use.

## 5. Open Questions — Decisions Needed Before Building

| # | Question | Status | Decision |
|---|----------|--------|----------|
| 1 | **DLC scope** | ✅ Decided | Base + Dawnguard + Dragonborn + Hearthfire always available. Anniversary Edition as an opt-in flag in settings modal. |
| 2 | **Location data** | ✅ Decided | Include broad hints (hold, environment, vendor type) where confident. Omit rather than guess. Added incrementally post-MVP. |
| 3 | **Mobile vs desktop** | ✅ Decided | Mobile-first. Responsive up to desktop. Filter bar collapses to bottom sheet on small screens. |
| 4 | **Theming** | ✅ Decided | 3 named themes: Nordic Dark, Parchment, System. CSS variables on `data-theme`. Selector in settings modal. |
| 5 | **CSS framework** | ✅ Decided | Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui — see §4.3. |
| 6 | **Shareable URLs** | ✅ Decided | Clean routes (not query params) for shareability and indexability. Dynamic combination paths are client-side routes; ingredient/effect pages are statically generated. |
| 7 | **Max combinations shown** | ✅ Decided | No cap — results are naturally bounded by ingredient selection and filters. |
| 8 | **Testing strategy** | ✅ Decided | Vitest unit tests for `alchemy.ts` and `value.ts` only. No UI tests. |
| 9 | **Custom domain** | Open | Start with `georgecampbel.github.io/skyrim`. Easy to add a domain later. |

## 6. MVP Scope (First Buildable Version)

To ship something useful quickly, the MVP is:

- [ ] Ingredient + effect data files (base game + all DLC incl. Anniversary)
- [ ] Linked two-column UI with selected / default / muted card states (§3.2)
- [ ] Bidirectional filtering: ingredient→effects and effect→ingredients
- [ ] Multi-effect grouped ingredient list (matches both / each effect)
- [ ] 3-ingredient cap with disabled state; deselection; clear-all reset
- [ ] Inline filter bar: plantable toggle, effect type, hide mixed results
- [ ] Settings modal: DLC content flags, perk selections, theme selector
- [ ] Tailwind theme setup: Nordic Dark + Parchment + System via CSS variables
- [ ] Homepage with navigation cards
- [ ] GitHub Actions deploy to GitHub Pages

**Out of scope for MVP:** value estimation, shareable URLs, standalone ingredient detail pages, location hints (added post-MVP via UESP scrape).

---

## 7. Future Tools (Roadmap Ideas)

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Enchanting Calculator** | Pick enchantment + soul gem + skill level + perks → effect strength and estimated value. Mirrors the potion tool. |
| **Trainer Finder** | Select a skill, see every trainer in the game: their level cap, location, hold, and any prerequisite quest. Filterable and faster than any wiki table. |
| **Standing Stones Reference** | All 13 stones with their effects, location by hold, and a brief note on which builds benefit most. Simple but much easier to digest than the wiki. |
| **Shout / Word Wall Tracker** | All 20 shouts listed with their 3 word locations. Check off words as you find them — progress saved to localStorage. |
| **Missable Content Checklist** | Quests, items, and dialogue that can be permanently locked out, with the exact conditions explained. Checkable, saved to localStorage. |
| **Skill Book Finder** | Every skill book in the game, filterable by skill. Mark books as read — saved to localStorage. |
| **Character Generator** | Shuffle/roll to get a randomised character concept: race, archetype (e.g. "Spellsword", "Stealth Archer", "Druid"), primary skill focus, and a short flavour blurb with starting suggestions. Rerollable by category so you can lock a race you like and randomise the rest. |
